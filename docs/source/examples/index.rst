The best way to get familiar with stdnet API is to dive into the tutorials.
In this section we will walk you though all the main aspects of the library,
following simple applications as examples.
We will refer back to the :ref:`library API <model-index>`
as much as possible so that
advanced configuration parameters and functionalities can be investigated.

The collection of tutorials examples is available in the
:mod:`examples` module in the source distribution.
