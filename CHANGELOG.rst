.. _vers08:

Ver. 0.8.2 - 2013 July 4
===============================
* This release only affects a critical bug fix in the
  :ref:`asynchronous redis publish/subscribe <redis_pubsub>`
  handler.
* **593 regression tests** with **93%** coverage.

Ver. 0.8.1 - 2013 July 2
===============================
* C++ :ref:`redis parser <redis-parser>`. Requires cython_ during installation.
* Primary key can have any name (previously only ``id`` was allowed).
* Better implementation for :meth:`stdnet.odm.Session.update_or_create`.
* Improved ``setup.py`` so that it does not log a python 2 module syntax error
  when installing for python 3.
* :ref:`Custom manager <custom-manager>` documentation.
* **590 regression tests** with **93%** coverage.

Ver. 0.8.0 - 2013 May 24
===============================
* This version brings several new functionalities, bug fixes, asynchronous
  connections and a departure from the global registration of models.
* The API for querying, committing and deleting instances has changed, and it
  it is now based on the :class:`stdnet.odm.Router` class.
* A :class:`stdnet.odm.Router` is a placeholder of registered models for
  one's application. Check the :ref:`registration tutorial
  <tutorial-registration>` for more details.
* Added preliminary support for :ref:`mongoDB backend <mongo-server>`.
  Pre-alpha at this stage.
* Added preliminary support for :ref:`Sql backend <sql-server>`.
  Pre-alpha at this stage.
* Can handle master/slave server configuration by registering models to a
  back-end server and read-only server for read operations (queries).
* Added :ref:`where <query_where>` selector for ad-hoc queries. The argument is
  a valid expression (lua_ for redis_ and javascript for mongodb_).
* AutoField has been renamed :class:`stdnet.odm.AutoIdField` and it does not
  inherit from :class:`stdnet.odm.IntegerField` so that it can work
  for different backends.
* Moved ``test`` module into the :mod:`stdnet.utils.test` module and refactored
  the main test class for handling tests on multiple back-ends at once.
* :class:`stdnet.odm.ManyToManyField` field can perform queries on the whole
  data-set of the model which maintains the
  :ref:`many-to-many relationship <many-to-many>`.
  To do so, the manager must be accessed via the class rather than an instance.
  Also the `through` attribute has been removed as it was equivalent to
  the `model` attribute. 
* The :ref:`load_only <performance-loadonly>` query method can be applied to
  field of related models.
* The :ref:`load_related <performance-loadrelated>` query method can now load only
  the ``primary key`` of the related element.
* Changed the default value of :attr:`stdnet.odm.ForeignKey.related_name` attribute
  to accommodate for multiple foreign keys with same related model in the same
  model.
* Fixed critical bug in :attr:`stdnet.odm.ForeignKey` with attribute ``required``
  set to ``False``. Previously the deletion of instances of the related
  model caused the deletion of the instances pointing to those deleted objects.
* Minor bug fix in lua ``odm`` script when sorting with respect related model
  fields which are missing.
* Added the new :meth:`stdnet.odm.StdModel.get_attr_value` method for
  retrieving nested attribute values using the (optional)
  :ref:`double underscore notation <tutorial-underscore>`.
* :attr:`stdnet.odm.Field.default` attribute made read-only.
* :meth:`stdnet.odm.Session.add` accept ``force_update`` parameter which can be used to
  force an ``update`` rather than an ``override`` when an instance is persistent and
  fully loaded.
* A new asynchronous redis connection for fully asynchronous usage of the api.
  Check the :ref:`asynchronous tutorial <tutorial-asynchronous>` for information.
* Refactored test suite to handle asynchronous and synchronous connections.
* Redis ``odm`` script is able to fix unique-keys/ids conflicts.
* **578 regression tests** with **93%** coverage.
  
.. _vers07:

Ver. 0.7.0 - 2012 Oct 25
===============================
* **It requires redis 2.6 or higher**.
* Supported python versions: 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3.
* Some backward incompatible changes in the API and database schema.
* Tons of new features including a richer query API, improved performance via custom
  query options, more flexible transactions and lua_ scripting for redis_.
* The `orm` module has been renamed `odm` for *object data mapper*. This was a painful change
  with the vast majority of files affected. But it is better to get terminology
  right at this stage rather than later.
* Redesign of :class:`stdnet.odm.ManyToManyField` which now uses a ``through`` model
  for building many to many relationships.
  *This is the only backward incompatible change both in terms of API and database scema*.
* Implemented :ref:`field lookups <range-lookups>` ``gt``, ``ge``, ``lt`` and ``le``.
* Added a *prefixed* redis client in :class:`stdnet.lib.redis.PrefixedRedis`.
* Added :class:`stdnet.odm.CompositeIdField` to handle situations where each
  combination of given set of :class:`stdnet.odm.Field` must be unique.
* Added ability to filter and search on :class:`stdnet.odm.ForeignKey` fields.
* Added :class:`stdnet.odm.Session` for managing transactions in the object
  data mapper.
* Moved structures from :mod:`stdnet.backends` to the :mod:`stdnet.odm` module.
* Added :meth:`stdnet.odm.Query.load_only` and :meth:`stdnet.odm.Query.dont_load`
  methods for loading a subset of a model fields.
  This can improve performance by reducing the amount of
  data transferred from the server to the client.
  Check the :ref:`performance tips <performance-loadonly>` regarding the
  new feature.
* Added :meth:`stdnet.odm.Query.load_related` for loading related
  fields of a queryset with a single database query. This can have huge
  :ref:`performance benefits <performance-loadrelated>` when you know you are
  going to access the related field in your model.
* Fixed bug in related managers. The ``exclude`` method was not implemented.
* :class:`stdnet.odm.PickleObjectField` uses the pickle protocol 2 for compatibility
  between python 2 and python 3.
* Refactored the ``save`` and ``delete`` method of model instances.
* Added :meth:`stdnet.odm.StdModel.tojson` method for obtaining JSON representation
  of model instances.
* Indexes for :class:`stdnet.odm.ForeignKey` fields are stored at sets with
  keys obtained from the field ``attrname`` rather than ``name``.
* Added :meth:`stdnet.odm.StdModel.clone` method for cloning model instances.
* Refactored :ref:`transactions <model-transactions>` to be used with
  :ref:`remote data structures <model-structures>` and
  :ref:`structured fields <model-field-structure>`.
* pulsar_ or nose_ are required to run the test suite and unittest2_ is required if
  using python 2.6.
* Moved the contrib module to :mod:`stdnet.apps`.
* Added :mod:`stdnet.utils.dates`.
* Added :mod:`stdnet.utils.path`.
* Added a Lua test suite for testing stand alone scripts. Requires lunatest_.
* Serialisation works for :attr:`stdnet.odm.ManyToMany.through` models via
  the :func:`stdnet.odm.all_models_sessions` function (issue #48).
* Lua script for univariate timeseries. This means the standard redis distribution
  works with the :class:`stdnet.odm.TS` structure.
* PEP 386-compliant version number.
* **624 regression tests** with **92%** coverage.

.. _vers06:

Ver. 0.6.2 - 2011 Nov 14
============================
* Critical bug fix in ``delete`` method when a model has no indices.
* Critical bug fix in :class:`stdnet.odm.ManyToManyField` which was causing the
  model ``delete`` method to crash.
* **297 regression tests** with **78%** coverage.

Ver. 0.6.1 - 2011 Sep 10
============================
* This is a minor release which brings an improved documentation,
  better support for the :class:`stdnet.odm.JSONField` and some minor
  bug fixes.
* Test suite parsing is done using the new python ``argparse`` module since the
  ``optparse`` is now deprecated. Check :ref:`running tests <runningtests>`
  for more information.
* Started work on ``lua extensions`` and added a development test tag ``script``.
* Added ``google analytics`` to the documentation web site.
* The instance validation algorithm catches :class:`stdnet.FieldValueError`
  exceptions and stores them into the errors dictionary.
* Fixed bug in :class:`stdnet.odm.Field` when using default values. Default values
  are regenerated if missing during the saving algorithm.
* Refactored redisinfo for a better redis monitor.
* **297 regression tests** with **78%** coverage.

Ver. 0.6.0 - 2011 Aug 9
============================
* **New database schema incompatible with previous versions**.
* This is a major release which brings into production a vast array
  of important new features including an improved database schema.
* :class:`stdnet.odm.StdModel` instances are mapped into separate redis hash
  tables with fields given by the model field names and values given by the
  instance field values.
* Implemented two types of sorting:
  *Implicit* by the :class:`stdnet.odm.Metaclass` attribute ``ordering``.
  When using this route, items are stored in the database in a sorted
  fashion, therefore no overhead is required for the sorting step.
  *Explicit* by using the ``sort_by`` method in
  a :class:`stdnet.odm.query.QuerySet` object.
  Check the :ref:`sorting <sorting>` documentation for more information.
* Unique fields (fields with :attr:`stdnet.odm.Field.unique` set to ``True``)
  are now indexed via redis_ hash tables which maps the field value to the
  object id. Previously they were stored in keys. This solution
  reduces the memory footprint and the number of keys used.
* Added :ref:`transaction support <model-transactions>`.
  This way model instances are always consistent even when redis
  shuts down during an update. Transactions are also useful when updating several
  instances at once.
* Added :ref:`serialization utilities <serialize-models>` for saving model
  data in JSON or CSV format. Custom serialization algorithms
  can be added to the library.
* Data encoders have been moved to the :mod:`stdnet.utils.encoders` module.
  There are four available, a dummy one (no encoding), `Default` to and
  from `unicode` and `bytes`, `Bytes` to and from bytes, `PythonPickle`
  to and from object and their pickle (bytes) representation and
  `Json` to and from structures and bytes.
* Added ``as_string`` parameter to :class:`stdnet.odm.JSONField` for
  specifying the storage method.
* Moved testing functions into the :mod:`stdnet.test` module.
* Added ``hidden`` attribute to :class:`stdnet.odm.Field`.
  Used in the search algorithm.
* Reorganized and expanded documentation.
* Bug fix in :class:`stdnet.odm.PickleObjectField` field.
* **289 regression tests** with **78%** coverage.

============================
* Several new features, some important bug fixes and more tests.
* Added :func:`stdnet.odm.from_uuid` function which can be used to retrieve a model
  instance from its universally unique identifier.
* Added pickle support to models. The `__getstate__` method return a tuple containg ``id``
  and a dictionary representation of scalar fields (obtained from the ``todict`` method).
* Bug Fix in :class:`stdnet.odm.JSONField`.
* Added tests for timeseries with date as keys (rather than datetimes).
* Bug fix in Backend and test suite, Redis port was not read.
* Bug fix in :class:`stdnet.contrib.timeseries`. The models were overridding
  the :meth:`__str__` rather than :meth:`__unicode__`.
* Added :func:`stdnet.odm.flush_models`, a utility functions for flushing model data.
* Added a new :class:`stdnet.odm.ByteField` which saves bytes rather than strings.
